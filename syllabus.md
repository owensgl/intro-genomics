### Course Communications

### Required Texts

There is no required text book for this class. All primary literature will be available on Brightspace.

All needed material is openly available on the course website. Additional texts will be linked in individual 
lessons if you're interested in the material.


### Course Description

An introduction to computational genomics. Class consists of a short introduction
to commandline programming and R, and then include practical excercises in genomics.
No background in computing is required.


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic biology and genetics. Completion of Biol 230. 


### Purpose of Course

In this course you will learn the fundamentals of how genomic data is generated 
and analyzed. You will have practical examples of code to run specific genomic 
techniques and have the skills to visualize the results. You will also have better
ideas on how to plan future genomic projects.


### Course Expected Learning Outcomes

Students completing this course will be able to:

* Navigate on unix command line.
* Use R for data wrangling and plotting.
* Understand how genomic data is generated.
* Run command line bioinformatic programs.
* Explain the principles behind genome assembly and variant detection.
* Turn sequence data into genetic variation.
* Run basic population genetic analyses.
* Explain how and why genomic data is generated.
* Present scientific analyses in oral and written form.


### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using largely a flipped, learner-centered, approach, because
learning to program and work with data requires actively working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but I think they
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If you're interested in
knowing more take a look at this great

### Instructional Methods

Class is divided into lectures on Tuesday and labs on Wednesday. The lecture will
cover fundamental and technical aspects of genomic methods and analyses. Before each 
lecture students will be required to read a primary literature article on the topic 
and submit answers to questions on Brightspace. The lab will involve demonstrations by 
the instructor, code along sections and independent or group work. While students are working on exercises the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve.

## Course Policies

### Attendance Policy

Attendance to the lecture portion is highly encouraged. Given the central importance of 
the lab exercises, attendance for the lab portion is mandatory and recorded. Missing more than 
two (2) lab sections will result in an incomplete in the course. 


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There will be two exams in this course. One on the week of the February 14th, the second 
on the week of April 3rd. Both exams will be on Brightspace, open-book and will occur outside of 
class time, with a flexible start time. Exams will not be cumulative, although concepts and material 
may span both exam periods. **You are not allowed to communicate with others or use AI software 
during exams**


### Make-up policy

Life happens and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 24 hours for
the submission of late assignments with no need to request an extension.
However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments on time when
possible because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up
if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted.
Assignments turned in after the 24 hour grace period without an extension will be
be graded with a 20% penalty.

Additionally, for pre-lecture questions, student grades will be based on  their best 
10 out of 11 assigments. This allows students to not hand in 1 assignment without grade 
penalty. 


### Assignment policy

Pre-lecture paper questions are due on Tuesdays at 1:30 pm Pacific Time on Brightspace. 
In lab assignments are due on Tuesday at 1:30 pm Pacific Time on Brightspace the week following 
the lab material. 

### Grade policy

| Item    | Percentage |
| -------- | ------- |
| Pre-lecture questions (10)  | 20%    |
| In lab assignments (9) | 27% |
| Mid term Exam 1 | 15%     |
| Late term Exam 2 | 15% |
| Final Group Project     | 23%    |

**To pass the course**, students must:
1. Complete exams 1 and 2
2. Attend the lab section for at least 11 out of 13 weeks.
3. Complete and present the final group project.
4. Score a final grade of 50.0 points for the entire course.

*If any of 1 through 3 are not completed, the student will automatically fail the course and receive an “N” 
(‘Incomplete’) on their transcript. If a student successfully completes 1 through 3, 
but is not successful in 4, they will receive an “F” on their transcript.*


### Course Technology

Students are required to work on Apple computers for the lab portion of the course. 
Apple computers are available in the lab space, and it is recommended that students 
use those and not personal laptops. Windows computers can complete the lab assignments
but the file system differences between operating systems can cause problems and 
complexity. 


### Materials and Supplies Fees

There are no materials and supplies fees for this course.

## Graduate Students
Graduate students taking Computational Genomics as a directed studies course have several differences from undergraduate students.
1. Graduate students will not take the exams.
2. Graduate students will work independently instead of groups on the final project.
3. Each graduate student final project will include additional requirements.
4. Graduate students will present a lecture on a topic relevant to the class.

| Item    | Percentage |
| -------- | ------- |
| Pre-lecture questions (10)  | 20%    |
| In lab assignments (9) | 27% |
| Lecture | 20% |
| Final Solo Project     | 33%    |
